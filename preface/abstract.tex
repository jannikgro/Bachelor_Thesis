Trading second-hand items on internet marketplaces is a rising business.
Both in terms of business opportunities and sustainability, it will become more important in the future.
But trading these items on internet marketplaces is challenging because of real-time competition and fierce price wars.
To optimize the pricing strategies using reinforcement learning, a simulation for re-commerce markets is introduced.
After an appropriate definition of dynamic pricing as markov decision process, three widespread algorithms are applied to this task:
Advantage Actor Critic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Soft Actor Critic.
This thesis aims to analyze and compare these algorithms in terms of performance, stability, and data efficiency.
It was found that the latest Soft Actor Critic Algorithm yields the best performance, while the classic Advantage Actor Critic provides the highest training stability.
