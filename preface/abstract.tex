Trading second-hand items on online marketplaces is a rising business.
Thereby, pricing is a major challenge.
E-commerce is highly dynamic, the product range is large, and fast reactions to competitors are required.
Thus, automation of pricing strategies is a necessary step for traders.
This thesis is about dynamic pricing with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a machine learning technology.
Today, thanks to intensive research in the past years, many different RL-algorithms exist.
Five of these algorithms are compared to competitive rule-based strategies in monopoly, duopoly, and oligopoly markets.
It is found that A2C, PPO, and SAC can succeed and outperform competitors, while DDPG and TD3 lack the necessary performance.
Later, several problems that arise in real-world applications are tackled and solved.
It is shown that missing some information about the competitor does not break the algorithms.
The problem of not knowing the opposite's strategy can be successfully solved by self-play.
