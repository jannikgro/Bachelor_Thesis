    % This section contains commands with important data for your thesis. Please adjust them in order for the document to be printed correctly.

    % Defines the length of the amount that a printed page will be cut from EACH side (including the inner side). This option only takes effect with \printVersiontrue and \professionalPrinttrue.
    \extraBorder{3 mm}

    % Shifts the inner margin outward by the amount specified. When the book is bound, part of the page will not be seen anymore. This option compensates for this loss. It only takes effect with \printVersiontrue.
    \bindingCorrection{6 mm}

    % Use the following command if this is a master thesis.
%    \bachelorThesisfalse

%    \printVersiontrue      % Use this value if you want to prepare your thesis for physical printing. In this case, links will not be colored. Without \professionalPrinttrue, the content will be moved outward by the binding correction, increasing the inner margin and decreasing the outer margin.
%    \professionalPrinttrue % Use this value if you want to have extra border for cutting and are not bound to paper formats (like A4). This option will increase the page size by the extra border on every side plus the binding correction once for the width. It only takes effect in combination with \printVersiontrue.
%    \fancyTheoremsfalse  % Use this value if you want to use the classical theorem style, where the text is italic. Further, with this style, the QED symbol is colorless.
%    \boldNumberSetsfalse % Use this value if you want variables for number sets (like N or R) to appear in blackboard bold rather than bold.

    % The title of the thesis. The first argument is for the English name, the second is for the German name.
    \myTitle{A comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms for dynamic pricing in recommerce markets}{Ein Vergleich von Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithmen für die dynamische Preisgestaltung auf Recommerce-Märkten}

    % The author’s name.
    \myName{Jan Niklas Groeneveld}

    % The author’s program.
    \myProgram{IT Systems Engineering}

    % The date when the thesis will be handed in.

    \additionalExaminers{Johannes Huegle\newline Alexander Kastius}

    % A short summary of the thesis. These information will be used for the PDF meta data.
