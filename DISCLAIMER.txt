The logos in core/title_page of the University of Potsdam (logo_UP.pdf) and the Hasso Plattner
Institute (logo_HPI.pdf) are both subject to copyrights of the respective institutions. I was
granted permission to include them as a part of this template. However, please note that you can
only use them when you comply with the following points:

    – You are not allowed to use the logos for any kind of advertisement.
    – You are only allowed to use any of these two logos if the thesis is connected to the
      respective institution (that is, the University of Potsdam or the Hasso Plattner Institute).
    – The logos must not be edited.

If you want to use the logos despite not complying with all of the points above, please contact the
respective institution and ask for permission.

The rest of this template does not follow any restrictions at all. You are allowed to do with it
whatever you want. Note that this means that you can use this template for other universities too as
long as you do not use any of the two logos mentioned above.
